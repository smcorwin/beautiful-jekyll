title: About Me
subtitle: ""
---
I was born and raised in Colorado Springs, CO, where my love of the outdoors was developed through activities such as hiking, camping, and snowboarding. My passion for environmental solutions led me to study environmental science and Chinese. Since graduating from Duke University in spring 2017, I have been living in China on a Fulbright research grant. When I'm not engrossed in my research, you can find me running, hiking, snowboarding, watching basketball, honing my photography and videography skills, listening to music, or reading.

**Boston University Shanghai Internship Study Abroad Program at Fudan University** | Fall 2015

Seeking to combine my environmental science and Chinese studies in a study abroad experience, I petitioned Duke to allow me to particpate in Boston University's Shanghai Internship Program.

While studying abroad in Shanghai, I took a Chinese class and courses on Chinese politics and society and interned part-time at a solar quality assurance, supply chain management, and engineering services firm.
