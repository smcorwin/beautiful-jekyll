I was born and raised in Colorado Springs, CO. Since graduating from Duke in spring 2017, I have been living in China on a Fulbright research grant. When I'm not engrossed in my research, you can find me running, hiking, watching basketball, honing my photography skills, listening to music, or reading.

## Education

### Duke University | Durham, NC
#### _Double B.A. majors in Environmental Science/Policy and Asian & Middle Eastern Studies (Chinese concentration)_

**Energy Reports and Carbon Pricing Bass Connections** | Fall 2016 - Spring 2017

Worked with a multidisciplinary team of faculty and students to develop recommendations and present them to Duke’s Executive VP about how to reduce on-campus energy consumption. Based on expertise gained related to carbon pricing and capital investment decision-making, made recommendations focusing on an internal carbon pricing program and educational programs. Created energy reports to convey energy consumption information to heads of departments. 

**Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Plant Subcommittee of Duke's Campus Sustainability Committee** | Spring 2017

Along with a multidisciplinary group of on-campus stakeholders, I helped make a recommendation to the Board of Trustees on Duke’s proposed on-campus 21 MW CHP plant. Contributed to evaluation of financial feasibility, the use of biogas, and potential alternatives using knowledge of the economics of electrical generation, CHP plants, and campus power networks.

**Solar Spring Break** | March 2017

Supported by the Duke University Energy Initiative, I spent Spring Break with six other Duke students in Fresno, CA, installing a solar array on a family's home with GRID Alternatives. [GRID Alternatives](https://gridalternatives.org/) is a non-profit seeking to bring renewable energy to underserved communities. I [filmed and edited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Spp3ySOloGU) a mini-documentary of our week in Fresno, which was also [reported on](http://abc30.com/society/students-spend-spring-break-installing-solar-panels-for-fresno-families/1806361/) by two local [news outlets](http://www.yourcentralvalley.com/news/duke-university-students-spend-spring-break-in-fresno-installing-solar-panels-to-low-income-family/674345469).

**Independent Study**: "The Growth and Development of China's Solar PV Market" | Spring 2016

Under the direction of Dr. Tim Johnson, I examined the policy drivers behind the development of China’s international and domestic solar photovoltaic (PV) market, the effect on global solar PV prices, and the impact on the solar markets of Japan, Germany, and the U.S.

**Duke Summer in China** | Summer 2014

Completed a year's worth of Mandarin Chinese while studying in Beijing on an intensive language immersion program. I was [featured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y27Ui5NA4A) in a short video Duke put together along with fellow classmates from the summer (this was my first year studying Chinese, my speaking abilities have improved drastically since then!). 

### Fudan University | Shanghai, China
#### Boston University Shanghai Internship Study Abroad Program | Fall 2015

While studying abroad in Shanghai, I took a Chinese class, courses on Chinese politics and society, and interned part--time at a solar quality assurance, supply chain management, and engineering services firm.
