### The Fulbright Program | *Fulbright Fellow*
##### July 2017 - Present | Nanjing, China
Analyzing the development of China’s domestic solar PV energy market through analysis of electricity market reforms, policy changes, and local government support. Investigating the prevalence of local protectionism by comparing provincial-level manufacturing output, installation subsidies, and installation statistics. Conducting interviews in Chinese with representatives from business, government, and academic sectors to compile a comprehensive report about the role of local governments in determining the layout of China’s solar energy market.

An article I wrote on China's solar energy market and the impact of tariffs imposed by the U.S. was published in [*The Diplomat*](https://thediplomat.com/2018/02/chinas-solar-power-dominance-and-trumps-trade-tariffs/).

**Critical Language Enhancement Award**

I spent my first four months in China on an intensive language immersion program in Harbin, China. My language study was focused on renewable energy research and terminology. 

### Asia Society Northern California | *Co-author*
##### November 2017 - Present | Nanjing, China
Co-authoring a report on clean technology collaboration between the U.S. and China. I have been primarily responsible for a section on case studies regarding commercial clean technology collaboration, with a particular focus on market access, finance and investment, and research and development. Analyzing barriers to entry for private Chinese and American companies seeking to access one another's market and identifying how certain companies have been able to overcome these barriers. Investigating financing and investment channels for U.S.-China clean technology collaboration, such as equity investment, venture capital investments, and joint ventures. Report will be published during summer 2018.

### Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) | *Energy Efficiency For All Intern* 
##### Summer 2016 | Washington, D.C.
Identified gaps in Energy Efficiency for All (EEFA), a program designed to expand access to energy efficiency upgrades in affordable multifamily housing. Single-handedly proposed and completed a 30-page report examining how to integrate solar PV with energy efficiency upgrades by analyzing barriers, policy and financial opportunities, and evaluating EEFA states to identify where pilot projects should be implemented. Presented findings to EEFA staff and partners to guide implementation.

While at the NRDC, I also [wrote a blog post](https://www.nrdc.org/experts/deron-lovaas/channel-square-where-sustainability-meets-affordability) about a new solar installation at a multi-family housing complex in Washington, D.C.

### Clean Energy Associates (CEA) | *Supply Chain Management Intern*
##### August 2015  - December 2015 | Shanghai, China
Produced an analysis and production recommendation of a solar module metallization and cell interconnect technology based on efficiency improvements and market compatibility. Completed competitive analysis research to help CEA identify major competitors and their business models. Developed strategic planning resources, focusing on policy in Japan and Mexico. Developed expertise in global solar supply chain, solar cell technology, and competitive analysis.

### Population Connection | *Population Education Intern*
##### Summer 2015 | Washington, D.C.
Developed and researched content for [environmental education resources](http://worldpopulationhistory.org/). Helped write and create curriculum to be used in environment classes in high schools. Other tasks included writing [environmental blog posts](https://populationeducation.org/book-review-lester-browns-the-great-transition/) and preparing educational workshops.
