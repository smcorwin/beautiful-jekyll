I am passionate about the environment and am committed to devoting my career to sustainable energy solutions. I am an experienced renewable energy market and policy analyst with strong research and communication skills (in both English and Mandarin Chinese). I'm interested in using proven qualitative and quantitative problem-solving abilities to develop and implement innovative clean energy solutions as part of a team.

Since graduating from Duke University in spring 2017, I have been living in China on a Fulbright research grant, where I am studying the development of China's domestic solar PV market. In my spare time, I have also been co-authoring a report with the Asia Society on clean technology collaboration between the U.S. and China.

My writing and analysis has been featured in publications and on sites such as [*The Diplomat*](https://thediplomat.com/2018/02/chinas-solar-power-dominance-and-trumps-trade-tariffs/), [Asia Society](https://asiasociety.org/northern-california/coordinated-strategies-asia-society-special-report), [the NRDC](https://www.nrdc.org/experts/deron-lovaas/channel-square-where-sustainability-meets-affordability), and [Population Connection](http://www.populationconnectionaction.org/2015/12/17/food-security-a-formidable-foe-for-a-nation-of-1-3-billion/).
